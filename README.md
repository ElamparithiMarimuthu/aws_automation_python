AWS Compliance Automation with Lambda and Python
Project Overview
This project focuses on automating AWS compliance management by ensuring that every EC2 instance created within an organization's AWS account is properly tagged with the owner's name. In organizations with multiple IAM users for developers, maintaining compliance can be challenging. This project aims to streamline the process by automatically tagging EC2 instances with the responsible developer's name upon creation.

Project Aim
The primary goal of this project is to automate the tagging of EC2 instances with the owner's name to ensure compliance with organizational policies. By implementing this automation, manual workload is reduced, and the risk of non-compliance due to human error is minimized. The project targets DevOps engineers responsible for managing AWS infrastructure and aims to simplify compliance monitoring and enforcement.

Solution Overview
Architecture
Lambda Function: Implemented in Python using AWS Lambda, the function is triggered by CloudTrail events for EC2 instance launches.
Event-Driven Approach: EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) is used to trigger the Lambda function upon specific API activities, such as EC2 instance launches.
Boto3 SDK: The Python Boto3 library is utilized to interact with AWS services, enabling the Lambda function to tag EC2 instances with the owner's name dynamically.
Implementation Steps
CloudTrail Setup: CloudTrail is configured to monitor API activity within the AWS account, specifically targeting EC2 instance launches.
EventBridge Configuration: EventBridge is set up to route relevant CloudTrail events to the Lambda function.
Lambda Function Development: A Python-based Lambda function is developed using the Boto3 SDK to tag EC2 instances with the owner's name.
IAM Role Configuration: The Lambda function is assigned an IAM role with the necessary permissions to interact with EC2 instances and apply tags.
Testing and Validation: The automation solution is tested by launching new EC2 instances to ensure that tags are applied correctly based on the owner's name.
Benefits
Automation: Reduces manual workload and minimizes the risk of non-compliance by automatically tagging EC2 instances with the owner's name.
Efficiency: Simplifies compliance monitoring and enforcement for DevOps engineers responsible for managing AWS infrastructure.
Scalability: The solution scales seamlessly with the organization's AWS environment, ensuring ongoing compliance as the infrastructure grows.
Future Enhancements
Enhanced Tagging Logic: Implement additional tagging logic based on organizational requirements or metadata associated with EC2 instances.
Integration with Compliance Tools: Integrate the automation solution with third-party compliance tools for comprehensive compliance management and reporting.
